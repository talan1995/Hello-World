# Hello-World

I'm Alan, the same Alan with Alan Turing.
It's the first time I use GitHub.
I'm currently a graduate student of computer science in NYU.
Hopefully, I will get an internship next year.
It would be cool if I can be a badass coder like Richard Hendricks. 
Or an engineer like invincible Tony Stark is just fine.
